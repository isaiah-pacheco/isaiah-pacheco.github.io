# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4, part 1

    This was a simple lab, but it was one of the most memorable for me. The assignment was to write code that converted units, which involved writing straightforward math formulas. I remember this lab because it was one of the first times I felt like I fully understood the code, and I felt like I could recreate it without the help of a lab partner or professor. 

* Lab 8, part 1

    This was one of my favorite labs because my lab partner and I worked very well together. The purpose of this lab was to calculate Olympic judge average scores, which had its own unique formula and we had to figure out a way to write it into code. I specifically remember both of us being excited when the outputs were finally correct. 

* Lab 12, part 1

    This was my most recent lab, and it’s one of my favorites because it was interesting to see the inner-workings of an animated gif. I found the assignment to be both enjoyable and challenging. Because it’s the latest lab, it also used many concepts and strategies from past labs that I liked.
